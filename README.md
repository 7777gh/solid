## SOLID - Principles that Apply

This page is destinated to collect some good resources (IMHO) in order to give
an overview over good priciples that should apply to software designe.

- [Intro to `SOLID`](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/SOLID_(object-oriented_design))
    - `S`: Single Responsibility Principle.
        - [link](http://www.oodesign.com/single-responsibility-principle.html)
    - `O`: Open/Close Principle.
        - [link](http://joelabrahamsson.com/a-simple-example-of-the-openclosed-principle/)
    - `L`: Liskov Substitution Principle.
        - [link](http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/lsp.pdf)
        - [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/56860/what-is-the-liskov-substitution-principle)
        - [Circle-Ellipse Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle-ellipse_problem)
        - **Moral of the story: model your classes based on behaviours not on properties; model your data based on properties and not on behaviours. If it behaves like a duck, it's certainly a bird.**
        - **This strongly suggests that inheritance should never be used when the sub-class restricts the freedom implicit in the base class, but should only be used when the sub-class adds extra detail to the concept represented by the base class as in 'Monkey' is-an 'Animal'.**
